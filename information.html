    <h2> Route 66 Timeline</h2>
    <p>Route 66 has an abundance of history, which continues to inspire many people.
      Below you will be able to read about the history in a timeline format, which goes into detail about how Route 66 was formed, and how it will hopefully continue to live on.</p>

          <p class="timelinep">Cyrus Avery, comissioner in Tulsa, Oklahoma, leads a charge to link Chicago, IL to Los Angeles, CA through Tulsa.
            By 1925, he is successful and launches a committee to stitch a plan for existing roads to be joined together to form what would be called 'Route 66'.</p>

          <h2 class="h2timeline">1926-1930</h2>
          <p class="timelinep">By the end of 1926, 800 miles of Route 66 was paved. A small step to completing the 2448 mile stretch, however, that did not put off potential businesses.
            Soulsby's Gas Station in Mt Olive, IL and The Old Log Cabin Restaurant in Pontiac, IL opened for business.
            February 4th 1927 saw the formation of 'The US 66 Highway Association', and saw the birth of the road it is situated on given the lifetime name of 'The Main Street of America'.
            <br><br>
            1928 saw the completion of Route 66 and the introduction of The “First Annual International Trans-Continental Foot Race”. The race covered the entire length of Route 66 to Chicago.
            The race and the first prize of $25,000 was won by Andy Payne, a 20-year-old from Claremore, OK.
            He covers 3,422.3 miles in 84 days, with an actual running time of 573 hours, 4 minutes and 34 seconds.</p>

          <p class="timelinep">After the end of World War II, Route 66 became an attraction as families start to travel for the first time.
            Heavy promotion from the association work well, with businesses flocking to open on the Route 66. However, 1953 saw one of the first main Interstate highways launched, signalling the future of America's roads elsewhere.
            1957 saw the National Interstate Highway System introduced, which by 1982, would revolutionise the American highways. Soon, Route 66 would no longer be as popular.</p>

          <p class="timelinep">America has moved on, however, it is still an attraction.
            Although, in 2018, it was stated that Route 66 was at risk of being lost due to neglect and future development plans.
            How long will Route 66 be around? We will have to wait and see.</p>
