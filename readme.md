# CTEC3905 Assignment
Below I will list the sources that I have used for this assignment, with an explanation of what I have use, where I have used it, and why. I will also give a short explanation of how I have configured the website with different files such as; independent JS files for different pages and independent CSS stylesheets.
## Index.html
The index.html page includes an image slider which is made purely from CSS. I have then used three images which I found online. The images are linked here: [Image 1,](https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/route-66.jpg?quality=85&w=1600)[ image 2,](https://loveincorporated.blob.core.windows.net/contentimages/fullsize/2e221dba-7dcb-41b6-adc4-074b0e77e277-route-66-in66-hours-pontiac.jpg)[ and image 3](https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/aa/24/e01a22ff43bb8c19dca2977e8949/route-66.jpg). I used a website guide to create the CSS slider, and I have adapted it as much as possible to make it my own. Due to how the image changes on the screen, it was hard to physically adapt the code to make it work without similarities. The slider CSS file is 'Slider.css' and the link to the guide I used can be found [here](https://www.cssscript.com/creating-a-linear-image-carousel-with-pure-css/).
## Information.html
The information.html page includes a timeline which is created in CSS. To complete this, I have followed the W3 Schools guide and adapted it to suit the needs of the website. It is fully responsive so it looks great on all screen sizes, and I have adapted it to make sure the code is different. You can view the W3 guide [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp).
## Map.html
The map.html page includes a Google Map which uses an external API to load up a map with coordinates I have included inside. This code is from Google themselves in their guides which I have used and adapted, however, as it uses an external API, a lot of the code had to have similarities for it to work with the map. You can view the guide [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/infowindows).
## ThingsToSee.html: JSON
I have used an external JSON file to add more functionality to this website. I originally was going to use the JSON file which is located in [JSON/ThingsToSee.JSON](JSON/thingstosee.json), however, as I was not using a server, I was getting a CORS issue. To resolve this, I have uploaded the JSON data to an online service which is hosting it. You can view that [here](https://www.npoint.io/docs/7862372fed7ff4d76748). I have then created functions which parse the JSON data and make it available to view in a table. The data for the JSON file itself is taken from a website called 'Pettits Travel'. You can view their website [here](https://www.pettitts.co.uk/blog/things-to-see-route-66). I have used the locations from their website and I have used Google Maps to obtain the coordinates.
### CSS Styles
I have decided to split up the CSS into different files. This is due a lot of CSS which was only being used on one page. For example; the slider on the Index.html page has been incorporated into it's own stylesheet in the CSS folder. I have also done this for the Google Map integration, the timeline on the information page and the table on the Things To See page. Each new stylesheet is linked on the page that requires it, with the global styles for each page being in the styles.css stylesheet.
### JavaScript
Each page has been configured with their own .js file for JavaScript to work. I though it was best to do this instead of one huge file as it allows for the code to be split up without unnecessary code on pages that wouldn't require it. All the files are linked in the page that requires them, and each file is placed in a JS folder for easy access.
